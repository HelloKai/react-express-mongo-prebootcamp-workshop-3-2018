She has extensive experience teaching programming to beginners, having coached the last batch of TechLadies as well as volunteering multiple times as a teaching assistant for her university’s introductory programming course. She’s super excited to be working with the first all-female coaching team for TechLadies in the most gender-balanced coaching batch thus far, and really wants to fight for the growth of gender diversity in the industry.
